# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SecureQrVotingSystem is a Java-based web application that provides a secure online voting platform with multi-factor authentication using QR codes and OTPs. The system ensures vote integrity through encryption and tamper-proofing mechanisms while providing comprehensive administrative capabilities for result management and audit trails. This system is designed as a portfolio-ready prototype demonstrating advanced security practices in web application development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a voter, I want to register and authenticate securely using QR codes and OTPs, so that I can participate in elections with confidence that my identity is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the registration page THEN the system SHALL display a form requiring username, email, and password
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create an account and generate a unique QR code for authentication
3. WHEN a user attempts to login THEN the system SHALL require QR code verification followed by OTP validation
4. WHEN a user scans their QR code (simulated via input) THEN the system SHALL generate and send a time-based OTP
5. WHEN a user enters a valid OTP within the time limit THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and create a secure session
6. IF an OTP expires or is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject authentication and log the attempt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a voter, I want to cast my vote securely with encryption, so that my vote remains confidential and cannot be tampered with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the voting interface THEN the system SHALL display available elections and candidates
2. WHEN a user selects a candidate and submits their vote THEN the system SHALL encrypt the vote using AES encryption
3. WHEN a vote is encrypted THEN the system SHALL generate a cryptographic hash for tamper detection
4. WHEN a vote is stored THEN the system SHALL record it with timestamp, encrypted content, and hash verification
5. WHEN a user attempts to vote multiple times in the same election THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate voting
6. IF vote encryption fails THEN the system SHALL reject the vote and log the error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage elections and view results through a secure dashboard, so that I can oversee the voting process and ensure election integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs into the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display election management options and current statistics
2. WHEN an admin creates a new election THEN the system SHALL allow setting election details, candidates, and voting periods
3. WHEN an admin requests vote tallying THEN the system SHALL decrypt votes, verify hashes, and calculate results
4. WHEN vote tallying is complete THEN the system SHALL display results with vote counts and percentages
5. WHEN an admin accesses audit logs THEN the system SHALL show all voting activities, authentication attempts, and system events
6. IF tampered votes are detected during tallying THEN the system SHALL flag them and exclude from results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive audit trails and security monitoring, so that I can ensure election transparency and detect any security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user action occurs THEN the system SHALL log the activity with timestamp, user ID, and action details
2. WHEN authentication attempts are made THEN the system SHALL record success/failure with IP address and timestamp
3. WHEN votes are cast THEN the system SHALL log voting events without revealing vote content
4. WHEN admin actions are performed THEN the system SHALL create detailed audit entries for accountability
5. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and detailed log entries
6. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and security measures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be built with modern Java technologies and security best practices, so that it's maintainable, scalable, and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL use Spring Boot framework for REST APIs and web services
2. WHEN data persistence is needed THEN the system SHALL use JPA/Hibernate with H2 database for development
3. WHEN QR codes are generated THEN the system SHALL use ZXing library for QR code functionality
4. WHEN encryption is performed THEN the system SHALL use Java Security API with AES encryption
5. WHEN the frontend is rendered THEN the system SHALL use Thymeleaf templates for user interfaces
6. WHEN the project is built THEN it SHALL use Maven with proper dependency management in pom.xml

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and documentation, so that the codebase is maintainable and the system's reliability is verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL include unit tests with minimum 80% code coverage
2. WHEN integration points exist THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for critical workflows
3. WHEN security features are implemented THEN they SHALL include specific security tests
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL include clear setup and running instructions
5. WHEN APIs are created THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and input validation
6. IF tests fail THEN the build process SHALL prevent deployment and report specific failures

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious stakeholder, I want all sensitive data protected and secure communication channels, so that the voting system maintains the highest security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
2. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL implement secure session handling with timeouts
3. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL simulate HTTPS communication patterns
4. WHEN passwords are stored THEN they SHALL be hashed using bcrypt or similar secure algorithms
5. WHEN input is received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all user inputs
6. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate countermeasures
